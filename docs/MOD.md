# Moving Object Detection (MOD)

## Description

Detection of moving objects involves utilizing techniques within computer vision and image processing. This method entails analyzing consecutive frames of a video using various algorithms to identify any instances of movement. The applications of moving object detection are diverse, including but not limited to video surveillance, activity recognition, monitoring road conditions, ensuring airport safety, and safeguarding marine borders. By segmenting moving objects from stationary elements within a frame, their motion can be tracked and analyzed retrospectively. Essentially, in the context of a video composed of individual frames, moving object detection aims to identify foreground targets that are in motion, either in each frame or upon their initial appearance in the video sequence.
